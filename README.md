# Zomato Case Study: SQL Queries and Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato's order and restaurant data using SQL queries. The aim is to derive insights from the dataset, such as restaurant performance, user activity, and financial summaries. The queries in this repository cover various aspects of the data, including revenue generation, customer orders, and menu item popularity.

## Project Structure
- **`zomato-schema.xlsx`**: Contains the schema of the Zomato dataset, providing a structure for tables and relationships between them.
- **`zomato-case-study-queries.docx`**: A document containing SQL queries designed to answer key questions related to Zomato's operations. These queries address tasks such as calculating restaurant revenue, finding the most popular menu items, and identifying inactive users.

## Key Queries
1. **Order and Restaurant Insights**: Analyze restaurant performance by calculating total revenue, order count, and average ratings.
2. **Menu Item Popularity**: Determine the most frequently ordered food items and the restaurant with the most diverse menu.
3. **User Activity**: Identify active and inactive users, and analyze user order behavior over time.

## Requirements
- SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Basic understanding of SQL for running and modifying queries

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-case-study.git
    ```
2. Load the Zomato schema from `zomato-schema.xlsx` into your database.
3. Run the SQL queries provided in `zomato-case-study-queries.docx` to generate insights.

## Future Work
- Add more complex queries for predictive analysis.
- Visualize results using Power BI or Tableau.
